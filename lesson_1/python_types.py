1 + 1 # these are pure integers, complete numbers. the result is '2'

3 / 1 # division ot integers will produce an integer. in that case, '3'.

5 / 3 # what is the result in that case?

1.0 + 1.0 # these are float numbers. they represent numbers with floating point. the result is '2.0'

5.0 / 3.0 # what about now?

try it!

# is there any difference? (no!)
# calling to "print" will always reproduce a string output!
